He went for a run and cause he was a diabetic his insulin levels dropped and hit his heads and then had swelling on his brain and passed away Saturday morning. One of the nicest chaps I've ever met and got to go on a holiday with him to Ardmore this summer. He was doing his run for his movember which since has now become the most donated individual movember page in the world! His movember is currently at around 38,000. No pressure for anyone donate just said I'd tell you's and send the link if you's wanted to donate: https://movember.com/m/14321044?mc=1. His name was Conor Cronin!",
